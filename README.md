<h2> Kubernetes is an open-source platform that helps to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this tutorial, we will be deploying a simple "Hello World" Django application on Kubernetes.
</h2>

## How to run this project 

<b>

1. Build the docer image  
</b>

```
$ docker build -t first:v1 .
```
<b>

Now that we have our Docker image, let's start a container based on that image. Run the following command:

</b>

```
$ docker run -it -p 8000:8000 first
```
<b>

This will start a new container based on the first-kubernetes image and forward traffic from port 8000 on your local machine to port 8000 in the container.

</b>

## go to the kubts folder  and run this code to run the application


```
$ kubectl apply -f pod.yml
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
$ kubectl apply -f service.yml
```

## Get  the external IP address to access the application from outside. 

```
$ minikube service first-service --url
```


## For demonstartion for the autohealing and autoscaling
